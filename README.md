- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DaveP89,
- I am a PC support professional doing lvl 1 & 2 IT support since pre Y2K
- I'm NOT a professional developer, rather programming is only really a hobby.
-  I have used Apple Basic, Visual Basic, VBScript (as a tech professional), and some Python. Iâ€™m currently trying to learn PowerShell for use on the job.
 - Also currently studying to re-up my IT certifications.
